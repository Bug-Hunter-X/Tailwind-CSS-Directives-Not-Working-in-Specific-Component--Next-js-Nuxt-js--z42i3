The solution usually involves ensuring that the component is correctly configured to use Tailwind directives.  This frequently involves correctly importing and applying the styles.   Here's how you might fix it in Next.js:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import styles from './MyComponent.module.css';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.redBackground}>
      <h1>This should work now</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

```css
/* MyComponent.module.css */
.redBackground {
  @apply bg-red-500;
}
```

**Explanation:**

This solution utilizes the `module.css` approach. Tailwind's `@apply` directive within the CSS module ensures that the styles are correctly applied while preserving the modular nature of Next.js components. This bypasses potential conflicts or misconfigurations that might arise within the main component's JavaScript file. Other frameworks may have similar solutions; the key is to make sure Tailwind is properly integrated into the component's style pipeline.
