# Tailwind CSS Directives Not Working in Specific Component

This repository demonstrates a rare bug in Tailwind CSS where directives fail to work within a specific component when using frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js. The issue stems from improper component configuration or setup, causing Tailwind's directive processing to fail.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as Tailwind directives, such as `bg-red-500`, not being applied within a particular component, despite working correctly elsewhere. Other components using the same directives render correctly.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server.
4. Observe that the `MyComponent` does not render with the expected Tailwind styling.
