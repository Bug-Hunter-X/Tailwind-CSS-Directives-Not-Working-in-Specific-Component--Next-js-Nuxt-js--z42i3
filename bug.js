This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, and you're trying to use a Tailwind directive within a component that hasn't been properly configured to use the directives.  The error will show up only when attempting to use a Tailwind directive within that component.  For example, using `className="bg-red-500"` might not work.

```javascript
//In a Next.js component
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-red-500">
      <h1>This won't work</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
